# Vision-Based Autonomous Navigation | ROS2 & OpenCV 🟥🐢

This project implements a modular, real-time autonomous navigation pipeline for a Turtlesim robot using **ROS2** and **Computer Vision**. The system processes live webcam frames to detect specific visual cues (red objects) and translates them into movement commands while maintaining safety through collision avoidance logic.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is designed with a decentralized approach, utilizing the **Publisher/Subscriber** pattern to ensure modularity and scalability.

1. **Image Detection Node (`image_detection.py`)**:
* Captures live video frames and converts them to the **HSV color space** for robust color segmentation.


* Applies binary masking and contour analysis to isolate the target object.


* Calculates the object's centroid and publishes directional commands (`left`, `right`, `center`, `none`) to a dedicated topic.




2. **Robot Control Node (`robot_control.py`)**:
* Subscribes to directional commands and the robot’s real-time pose (`/turtle1/pose`).


* Translates high-level directions into precise `Twist` messages (linear and angular velocity).


* 
**Wall Avoidance Logic**: Implements proximity monitoring to prevent collisions with the environment boundaries, ensuring system robustness.





## 🧠 Key Technical Features

* 
**Real-Time Processing**: Optimized OpenCV pipeline for low-latency object tracking.


* 
**HSV Color Masking**: Superior noise rejection compared to RGB-based detection.


* 
**Modular Node Design**: Separation of concerns allows for easy debugging and potential integration with physical hardware.


* 
**Edge Case Handling**: Integrated safety logic for boundary management.



## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* ROS2 (Humble/Foxy)
